This is a sample rail applicatioon created to try
  - creating a sample rails application on RubyMine
  - using sqlite database
  - sync and use with github as VCS
  - use Rspec and capybara as testing framework
  - deploy the app on heroku platform

This was the first prototype to understand & connect the unknowns and see if it actually worked.
Having this in place will give me hope & confidence to build the first rails project for csc517
